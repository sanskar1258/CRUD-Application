Project Description: Employee Management System
Overview:

The Employee Management System is a web-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application designed to manage employee records. It leverages the Spring Boot framework to provide a robust and scalable solution. The application focuses on proper validation, error handling through custom exceptions, and a well-organized package structure.
Features:

    Employee Entity:
        The core entity is Employee, representing employee details such as first name, last name, and email.
        Proper validation annotations are applied to ensure data integrity.
        The Employee class includes methods for converting to and from DTOs.

    DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):
        EmployeeRequestDto: Represents the data sent by clients for creating or updating employees. Includes validation annotations.
        EmployeeResponseDto: Represents the data sent to clients in response to read operations. Provides a simplified view of employee details.

    Controller Layer:
        EmployeeController: Handles incoming HTTP requests related to employee management.
        Utilizes DTOs for input and output to maintain a clear API contract.
        Proper exception handling for resource not found scenarios.

    Service Layer:
        EmployeeService: Contains business logic for employee-related operations.
        Utilizes the repository for database interactions.
        Transforms between entities and DTOs for proper data handling.
        Custom exceptions (ResourceNotFoundException) for error scenarios.

    Repository Layer:
        EmployeeRepository: Uses Spring Data JPA for database interactions.
        Provides methods for CRUD operations.

    Exception Handling:
        Custom exception (ResourceNotFoundException) for handling cases where a requested resource is not found.
        Global exception handler (@ControllerAdvice) to manage and customize exception responses.

    Validation:
        Validation annotations (e.g., @NotBlank, @Size, @Email) applied to entities and DTOs for input data validation.
        Custom validation messages to provide meaningful error responses.

    Package Structure:
        dto Package: Contains DTOs (EmployeeRequestDto, EmployeeResponseDto).
        model Package: Holds the core entity (Employee) and conversion methods.
        controller Package: Houses the EmployeeController for handling HTTP requests.
        service Package: Includes the EmployeeService interface and its implementation (EmployeeServiceImpl).
        repository Package: Contains the EmployeeRepository interface.
        exception Package: Houses the custom exception (ResourceNotFoundException).

    Logging:
        Utilizes SLF4J and logs information using LoggerFactory for proper logging.

Deployment:

The application can be deployed as a standalone Spring Boot application, packaged as a JAR file or a Docker container, and run on a servlet container.
Technologies Used:

    Spring Boot
    Spring Data JPA
    Hibernate
    Java Persistence API (JPA)
    Validation API (JSR-380)
    SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java)

Conclusion:

The Employee Management System provides a well-structured, validated, and exception-handled CRUD application for managing employee records. It demonstrates best practices in Spring Boot development, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and a robust user experience.
